# Lemonade

Lemonade is a web framework for iOS app UI designing and prototyping. It provides features available in web that desktop native UI designing tools may not have:

- Document stream
- Multiple inheritance
- Font fallback
- Padding and margin

If you already know web design and frontend programming and want to design your iOS app in the web way, you could try Lemonade.

Lemonade is not a replacement for Bohemian Sketch, Adobe Illustrator or Adobe Photoshop. You should use both together, if you use Lemonade.

Currently, Lemonade is still under development. Alpha release coming soon.
